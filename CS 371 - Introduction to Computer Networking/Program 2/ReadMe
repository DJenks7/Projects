To run, type make to execute Makefile.
Executing the Makefile will create an executable file.

Then run the executable file with three arguments.
	1.	Forwarding Table.
	2.	Packets to be Forwarded.	
	3.	Name of file containing output IP packets.

CORRECT SYNTAX
	./Program2 [Forwarding Table].txt [Packets to be Forwarded] [Output IP Packets]

Before the program can run correctly, it must have valid parameters. Where the first parameter
is the file name of the forwarding table, the second parameter is the name of the file containing
several IP packets, and the third parameter is the name of a file containing output IP packets.
The program when run correctly will process each packet in the files given and determine their correct
destination to be forwarded to.
